# Machine Learning Without Libraries

Nowadays, using simple machine learning algorithms is as easy as `import knn from ...` but it doesn't make sense if you really want to learn how this algorithms work and how to write them. Therefore, I'm trying to write this algorithms using none of ML Libraries. (I only use the mathematics libraries and sometimes plotting libraries.)
